# 2DCollisionDetection
Proof of concept for AABB collision in 2D

Should be relatively trivial to add to a "real" game.

Optimization needed in cell removal, otherwise should be fairly fast.
Probably not the best method, but easily understandable.

Coded in C# using Monogame Framework and Visual Studio.
